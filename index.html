				<p>While the last 10 years at Entwine Events have been filled with exciting changes and new adventures we’ve decided to make our biggest change yet. Back in 2019 Chelsea and Caitlin decided 2020 would be our last year orchestrating and designing beautiful events. Covid had different plans in mind and we had to push our end date and announcement out a bit as we finalized postponed weddings and did our best to guide our final couples through these tough times. The time has finally come to announce that we will be closing our doors in order to spend more time with our growing families as we feel our souls pulling us in that direction. As you all know we put everything we have into our work and are simply unable to continue to do so while also trying to nurture our little ones.</p>

				<p>We want to thank each and every one of you for your support, collaboration, and love throughout the years. We are honored to have had the opportunity to work with you and humbled by the kindness you have shown us time and time again.</p>

				<p>We hope this isn’t a goodbye to the industry we care so deeply about but we aren’t sure where each of our paths will take us. If there is absolutely anything you need from us in the coming weeks as we take the necessary steps to shut our doors, please don’t hesitate to reach out to <a href="mailto:hello@entwineeventsplanning.com">hello@entwineeventsplanning.com.</a>. We are always here for you.</p>

				<p>Again thank you for for the role you’ve had in our professional endeavors over the last decade! We appreciate you all so much.</p>

				<span>The Entwine Team</span>
